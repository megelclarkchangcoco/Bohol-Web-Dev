                                    <p>Cebu City Island, south-central Philippines. Located on Cebu Island’s eastern coast, it is protected by offshore Mactan Island and by the inland Cordillera Central. It is one of the country’s largest cities and is a bustling port. Its harbour is provided by the sheltered strait between Mactan Island and the coast. Cyberlordmaster The country’s oldest settlement, it is also one of its most historic and retains much of the flavour of its long Spanish heritage. A thriving port occupied the site when Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese navigator and explorer, landed there on April 7, 1521. He sealed a blood compact with Humabon, the chief of Cebu, but was killed later by Chief Lapulapu of nearby Mactan Island. On April 27, 1565, Miguel López de Legazpi and the friar Andrés de Urdaneta arrived on Cebu and founded the first Spanish settlement and Catholic mission in the Philippine archipelago. For six years, until Legazpi’s removal to Manila, Cebu was the Spanish colonial capital. It remained the primary Spanish bastion in the southern part of the Philippines. The cultural and commercial core of the central Visayan region, Cebu was opened to foreign trade in 1860. It was chartered as a city in 1936. Although it imports few foreign goods, it is the main collection centre for such interisland commodities as copra, abaca, sugar, timber, and fish. Cebu is a major point of passenger traffic by air and sea and is served by an international airport across the harbour on Mactan Island. Many Manila-based industrial and commercial firms maintain branches in Cebu City. Warehousing and assembly plants for wholesale trade are important to the economy. Textiles, footwear, processed foods, vegetable oil, furniture, and chemicals are leading products. Other manufactures include cosmetics, candles, pearl and aquamarine jewelry, and sistas (guitars and ukuleles), the latter primarily made on Mactan Island. The city is easily accessible from all points on Cebu Island. A coastal railway reaches from Cebu City north to Danao and south to Carcar, and highways cross the nearby Cordillera Central. During World War II, the city was almost destroyed by the Japanese in May 1942, but the port was left intact. The city was subsequently rebuilt and enlarged. Its layout follows the configuration of the shoreline, with the main business district adjoining the port area. Urban residents are concentrated nearby, and population influx has contributed to a housing shortage. Suburbs are located to the north and south along the coastal plain. Cebu City is a Roman Catholic archbishopric and is a centre of education. It is the site of five major universities: the University of San Carlos (1595), Cebu Institute of Technology (1946), Southwestern University (1946), University of the Southern Philippines (1927), and University of the Visayas (1919). The ruins of the Spanish Fort San Pedro are near the harbour.</p>

                                    <p>Millions of people participated in Cebu City last Sunday to celebrate the Sinulog Festival, one of the most famous festivals in the Philippines. It was attended, not only by Filipinos, but people coming from different parts of the globe also went to witness the celebration. The magnificence of the festival made Filipinos, as well as our fellow Asians, refer to it as the “Mother of all Festivals”. From the colorful and well-made costumes of the dancers, to the beautiful dances and to the music brought by the drums, trumpets, and the native gongs, the Sinulog Festival never ceases to amaze its audience. For 32 years, the Sinulog Festival is a traditional celebration in Cebu City held every third Sunday of January to honor the Santo Niño (Child Jesus). Basically, the festival is done by a dance ritual, in which it tells the story of the Filipino people’s pagan past and their acceptance of Christianity. The word “Sinulog” means “graceful dance”, wherein it all started in 1980 with a simple dance that represents the “sulog” (or current) of a river in Cebu. With the celebration’s evolution, the Sinulog Festival has become a month long tradition in Cebu. The most-awaited feature, nevertheless, is the Sinulog Grand Parade which was held on the 15th day of January. “One Beat, One Dance, One Vision. Cebu – City of Culture” was the theme adopted for the 2012 Sinulog Festival. As the festival becomes more and more famous each year, tourists would never want to miss the opportunity to watch it and became more and more commercialized. The festival now, not only consists of costumes and dances, but also contests, such as art exhibits, beauty pageants, photo contests, and singing and dancing contests. Participants may also join the festival’s activities, such as concerts, cultural shows, fireworks display, fun runs, and street fairs. For the past 18 years, it has made the Filipinos residing in New Zealand celebrate their own version each year, a proof on how big of an influence the festival is. It has also been recognized as the “City of Culture” by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The 2012 Sinulog festival embraced the perks of technology, as it was broadcasted live in a major television and, for all the people in the world to see, it was also streamed online. With the overwhelming amount of people who wish to witness the traditional celebration and the beauty of the culture it depicts, this grand festival remains as Cebu’s proudest attraction, along with the beautiful beaches and historical places.</p>

                                    <p>Kawasan has many waterfalls. The first one is the largest of the three and is usually the most crowded. An uphill climb for fifteen minutes will take you to the second waterfall, and another, and another. It’s a good idea to bring in your own food, the resort’s restaurants are not cheap and prices are not marked. We ran into problems with the prices getting higher as the day went on.
Cottages (1,500 to 2,500 PHP) and tables (500php) are also available for rent, the rooms are for overnight stay. You can rent a raft (300 PHP) to take you around the “pool” or for a refreshing “shower massage” under the falling water. Life vests are also available for rent.
The pathway back is very dark once the sun sets so it’s best to bring a flashlight. You should be extra careful in going down the slope, especially the one descending from the second or third falls to avoid mishaps or accidents.
Kawasan Falls is a great get-away destination in the southern part of Cebu for families and gatherings.</p>

                                    <p>Magellan’s Cross holds a very big part of the history of Cebu. It is believed to be a Christian cross planted by the Portuguese and Spanish explorers headed by Ferdinand Magellan. It was planted upon their arrival in Cebu on March 15, 1521. That day also marked the birth of Christianity in the land.

The original cross was believed by the people of old to have miraculous healing powers so they started chipping it away. Because of that, the government officials was prompted to supposedly encased it in another wooden cross made from tindalo.It is now housed in a small chapel. Rumors say though that the original cross was destroyed or disappeared after the death of Magellan.</p>

                                    <p>the Garces family — owners of Ruthy’s Lechon — claims that the first lechon recipe of Talisay is from their matriarch, Mila Candeja Garces. The recipe remains a top secret but, typical of Cebu lechon, sauces are not necessary to make the pig delectable.In the 1930s, the idea of the lechon belly was born after the lechonero family behind Johnna’s Liempo Haus in Balamban, Cebu noticed the belly of the pig is always the first to go.“Ang pinakamasarap sa liempo, 'yong belly. Pareho lang naman ang timpla sa buong liempo, pero nag-try lang ako sa belly,” shares Bobet Mapa, the owner of Johnna’s Liempo Haus.So popular is the lechon belly concept that apart from having many competitors, Johnna’s Liempo Haus sells around 200 liempos a day.The belly, really, is where it’s at. “We claim na pinakamasarap [ang Cebu lechon] kasi ang dami naming nilalagay na pampabango sa tiyan," continues Alix. Cebuanos put all the herbs right in the belly, "so when you open the belly, lalabas 'yon lahat."The pig is slow roasted for five hours over coal, “so all that has time to seep through the meat. Kaya wala kaming sawsawan.”</p>

                                    <p>Coming from the Spanish word which means “stew pot”, Pochero is another dish that you should watch out for in Cebu, especially during the rainy season. There is nothing better than to indulge in a hot bowl of beef soup during cold weatherSome other Filipinos might know of this dish by its other name, Bulalo. But as it is now, Cebuanos have made it their own by incorporating their own local flavour. There are several restaurants in Cebu which have become institutions for their Pochero dish.You can even try the sizzling version, which is served with gravy rather than soup, but features the same rich taste.</p>

                                    <p>Prided as the country’s oldest and smallest fort, Fuerte de San Pedro or more popularly known as Fort San Pedro, is another well-known tourist attraction in Cebu. It was built as a military defense structure under the command of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first governor-general in the Philippines.
Its long and rich history is a true delight for tourists. Among other things, the Fort was once an army garrison, prison camp, school, hospital, and even a zoo! Today, Fort San Pedro is a historical park under the supervision of the local government. To add, part of the Fort was converted into a museum that has Spanish artifacts, paintings, old photographs, and historical documents in it.
After visiting the museum, you can wander around the fort’s triangular shape, where two sides are facing the sea and the other facing the city. While you’re at it, take a snapshot with a real cannon or simply enjoy the magnificent view the roof deck has to offer.
The Fort is a few walks away from Magellan’s Cross. Entrance fee is Php 30 (around USD 0.60) for adults and Php 20 (USD .40) for students</p>

                                    <p>Walking distance from Fort San Pedro is Cebu Heritage Monument. It is an extravagant bronze tableau masterpiece by local artist Eduardo Castrillo and was constructed from July 1997 to December 2000. The work depicts the most historical events of Cebu – starting from the time of Rajah Humabon, the infamous Battle of Mactan, up to the beautification of Cebuano martyr Pedro Calungsod.
The monument is located in the Parian Plaza of Cebu’s Parian District. The Parian has historical merit of its own as the district was built exclusively to house Chinese merchants and their families in Cebu during the Spanish period. To get you excited, visitors can enter the enclosure of the monument for free. But donations are always welcome! While in the district, check out the Jesuit House and the Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House</p>

It is one of the oldest homes in the Philippines and is believed to be the oldest Chinese house outside of China. The ancestral house was built by Don Juan Yap between 1675 and 1700 for his growing family: his wife Dona Maria Florido and their three children, Maria, Eleuterio, and Consolacion Despite its age, the “Balay nga Bato ug Kahoy” still remains commanding and enchanting as ever. Its secret ingredients? The beautiful coral stones and egg whites that make the walls; and the molave, balayong, and terracotta glue that keep the roof strong.
 Inside, the 2-storey structure is adorned with beautiful pieces that will make you travel through time. Period artworks, well-crafted sculptures, antique designs, and native furniture shower the interior with Filipino, Spanish and Chinese influences. Also present are religious icons and images that remind guests of the Yap-Sandiego’s close devotion towards their faith.
The Ancestral House is currently under the supervision of Val Sandiego, the great-great-grandson of Dona Maria Yap-Sandiego and a great supporter of the heritage and the arts. He has vowed to preserve the house for generations to get a glimpse of old Cebu. The House is open to the public with a a small fee of Php 50 (USD 1) per guest.</p>

                                    <p>Located a few blocks from the Yap-Sandiego Ancestral House is the Museo de Sugbo. Museo de Sugbo, or the Cebu Provincial Museum, holds a unique history of its own. Designed by Domingo de Escondrillas (Cebu’s only architect at that time), the structure was built in 1871 as the Carcel de Cebu, or the provincial jail. The carcel was originally intended to be the main prison of the Visayas Island, which would account for the establishment’s large size.
During its 135-year run, the carcel served as prison not only to convicted criminals but also to Katipunero captives. It became a horse stable during the American era. During the Japanese occupation, it once again became prison, until it was formally named as the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC). The CPDRC has been relocated and in August 2008, the former prison camp was formally inaugurated as a provincial museum.
Today, Museo de Sugbo detains important historical pieces for locals and tourists to admire. It has four galleries, including the presidential gallery with portraits of the Philippine presidents and an archeological gallery with gold and ceramic artifacts of the renowned San Diego shipwreck. End your tour by visiting the wishing Well of Wisdom, Love, and Good Fortune. According to historians, the well provided the water supply for the complex during its carcel era.
Museo de Sugbo charge Php 75 (USD 1.50) per guest for foreigners and Php 30 (USD 0.40) per guest for Filipino visitors.</p>

                                    <p>Ride a cab to Lapu-Lapu City and head on to our last stop – the Mactan Shrine! Built to commemorate Philippine’s first battle, the Mactan Shrine is Cebu’s tribute to Datu Lapu-Lapu for defending Cebu from the invading Spaniards, led by Ferdinand Magellan, in the Battle of Mactan that happened on April 27, 1521. To pay homage to both historical figures, the Mactan Shrine holds the Lapu-Lapu Shrine and the Magellan Shrine.  
The Lapu-Lapu Shrine has a 20-meter bronze statue of the Datu and is believed to be the exact spot where the battle occurred. To give you an idea of how valuable Lapu-Lapu’s place in history is, he is considered as the first Philippine native to resist foreign invasion – making him the first national hero of the Philippines. How cool is that?  Even noteworthy is the fact that Lapu-Lapu and his warriors only used crude weapons of iron swords and bamboo spears to win against the heavily-armed Spanish invaders.
Adjacent to the Lapu-Lapu Shrine is the Magellan Shrine which shelters the Magellan Monument and the Magellan Marker. Built in 1866, the Magellan Monument is a memorial tower that holds different inscriptions on each side, including Magellan’s name in Portuguese. On the other hand, the Magellan Marker is a panoramic painting of the Battle of Mactan that was placed in 1941. The Shrine is located along Punta Engaño Road, Lapu-Lapu City. Entrance is free but donations are welcomed.</p>
